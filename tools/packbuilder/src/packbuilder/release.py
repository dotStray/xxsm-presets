"""Publishing: pack zips, ``index.json``, and GitHub releases.

The app reads ``index.json`` from this repository's ``main`` branch, which lists the newest
versions of each game with its zip's address and checksum. A build that changes anything makes
**one** release, tagged with the day (``2026.09.26``, ``.01`` for a second that day), holding a
``<game>-<version>.zip`` for each game whose pack changed and notes saying what changed in each.
Every other game's current pack is attached to it again, so the newest release always has all of
them and nobody has to look back through older ones (the user's choice, 2026-09-27). That copy is
the published zip itself, downloaded and checked against ``index.json``'s checksum — not zipped
again, because the same files compress differently under another zlib (a runner's against
zlib-ng, measured). ``index.json`` then points at the newest copy, so an older release can be
deleted without taking a current pack with it.

A release is created *before* ``index.json`` points at it, so the app can never be told about
a zip that does not exist yet. Before publishing, every address in ``index.json`` is checked
against the releases that exist: one whose release was deleted is dropped, and a game whose
current pack was deleted is published again.
