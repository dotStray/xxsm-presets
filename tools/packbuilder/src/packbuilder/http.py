"""The one way the builder talks to the internet.

The rules every source gets, whoever wrote the adapter:

- an honest ``User-Agent`` naming the project and where to find it;
- at most one request a second to any one host;
- a cache on disk, keyed by address, that a rebuild reads instead of asking again, and that
  ``--no-network`` builds from alone;
- failures are raised as :class:`FetchError` with the address and the reason, never swallowed —
  every way a connection can fail, not only the common ones, so one broken answer stops one game;
- no answer larger than :data:`MAX_BYTES`;
- a ``Retry-After`` is waited out, up to :data:`MAX_RETRY_AFTER`, and a longer one is a failure;
- a site's ``robots.txt`` is read before anything else is asked of it (GitHub's API and files are
  used under GitHub's API terms instead), and a path it disallows is not fetched.
